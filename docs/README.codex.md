# Superpowers for Codex

Guide for using Superpowers with OpenAI Codex via native skill discovery.

## Quick Install

Tell Codex:

```
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

## Manual Installation

### Prerequisites

- OpenAI Codex CLI
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git ~/.codex/superpowers
   ```

2. Create the skills symlink:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
   ln -s ~/.codex/superpowers/skills ~/.agents/skills/superpowers
   ```

3. Restart Codex.

### Windows

Use a junction instead of a symlink (works without Developer Mode):

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills"
cmd /c mklink /J "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\superpowers" "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\superpowers\skills"
```

## How It Works

Codex has native skill discovery — it scans `~/.agents/skills/` at startup, parses SKILL.md frontmatter, and loads skills on demand. Superpowers skills are made visible through a single symlink:

```
~/.agents/skills/superpowers/ → ~/.codex/superpowers/skills/
```

The `using-superpowers` skill is discovered automatically and enforces skill usage discipline — no additional configuration needed.

## Usage

Skills are discovered automatically. Codex activates them when:
- You mention a skill by name (e.g., "use brainstorming")
- The task matches a skill's description
- The `using-superpowers` skill directs Codex to use one

### CLI Tool (Advanced)

The Codex CLI tool at `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex` provides additional commands:

```
Run ~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex find-skills
Run ~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex use-skill superpowers-ng:brainstorming
Run ~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex bootstrap
```

### Project Skills

Create project-specific skills in `.codex/skills/` within your project root:

```bash
mkdir -p .codex/skills/my-project-skill
```

Create `.codex/skills/my-project-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-project-skill
description: Use when [condition] - [what it does]
---

# My Project Skill

[Your skill content here]
```

Project skills have the highest priority and override both personal and superpowers skills with the same name. Use the `project:` prefix to explicitly load a project skill:

```
Run ~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex use-skill project:my-project-skill
```

### Personal Skills

Create your own skills in `~/.agents/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/my-skill
```

Create `~/.agents/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when [condition] - [what it does]
---

# My Skill

[Your skill content here]
```

The `description` field is how Codex decides when to activate a skill automatically — write it as a clear trigger condition.

### Skill Priority

Skills are resolved with three-tier priority: project (`.codex/skills/` in project root) > personal (`~/.agents/skills/`) > superpowers (`~/.codex/superpowers/skills/`).

### Tool Mapping

Skills written for Claude Code are adapted for Codex with these mappings:

- `TodoWrite` → `update_plan`
- `Task` with subagents → Tell user subagents aren't available, do work directly
- `Skill` tool → `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex use-skill`
- File operations → Native Codex tools

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/.codex/superpowers && git pull
```

Skills update instantly through the symlink.

## Uninstalling

```bash
rm ~/.agents/skills/superpowers
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\superpowers"
```

Optionally delete the clone: `rm -rf ~/.codex/superpowers` (Windows: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\superpowers"`).

## Troubleshooting

### Skills not showing up

1. Verify the symlink: `ls -la ~/.agents/skills/superpowers`
2. Check skills exist: `ls ~/.codex/superpowers/skills`
3. Restart Codex — skills are discovered at startup

### Windows junction issues

Junctions normally work without special permissions. If creation fails, try running PowerShell as administrator.
